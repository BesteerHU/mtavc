# MTA Vice City Roleplay
An open-source Multi Theft Auto Vice City Roleplay gamemode

# About
This gamemode based on the Vice City map, with the same musics and feelings. There is no vehicle or skin model, because you can import the mods that you want.

# License
You can use this gamemode anytime, without my permission, you just have to display my name (araski) anywhere. This can be on the screen with a gui or a dxDraw or in an outputChatBox when the player connects to the server (included).

# Updates
This is just a hobby project, I am doing several projects at the same time so it's not easy to keep up to date this mod, but I will do my best.

# Contact
If you have any questions you can reach me at info@raskimatyas.hu email address.
